When registering with a username and password, accept existing credentials
if they authenticate successfully.

=item *

When autoregistering, attempt to write a test identity before attempting
to register credentials.

Always remove the existing identity symlink before overwriting, as -e $fn
can return false for a symlink that still exists.

=item *

Added several error checks to the register process.

=item *

Disconnect from the register server before returning when errors occur.

=item *

Ensure that checks and reports are sent to the appropriate servers. [Bug

the provided value.  [Gentoo #101070]

=back

=head2 2.75 (July 6, 2005)

=over 4

=item *

Removed two debugging statements accidentally checked into 2.74.

=item *

Applied syslog patch from Debian bug #295727 to reintroduce support for
'sys-syslog' and 'syslog' log targets.  [Feature #1229433]

=item *

Modified Makefile.PL to honor DESTDIR when installing section 5 man
pages.  [Bug #1227167]

=item *

Fixed failure for razor-agents to exit with error when unknown
parameters were specified.  [Bug #1229450]

=item *

Fixed bug for when razor-agents was invoked without ``-f'' but reading
from STDIN, causing the shell to be unusable until the forked
background process was killed off.  [Bug #1229887]


=back

=head2 2.74 (June 28, 2005)

=over 4

=item *

Fixed handling of configuration options; under certain circumstances,
neither the defaults nor the configuration file would set necessary
variables such as C<listfile_discovery>.

=item *

Fixed handling of -home option; when provided, it will be accepted
without further checks.

=item *

Fixed installation of man(5) pages by non-root users to local man
directories.  [Patch #1227162]

=item *

Reverted a patch that was intended to add support for overriding
razorhome under certain circumstances.  The patch introduced new
issues with external program integration (eg. Amavis).
[Bug #1074391]

=item *

Corrected a spelling error in a debug message.

=item *

Added several defined checks to avoid unnecessary warnings when
manipulating server lists.

=item *

Corrected the preprocessing fix shipped with 2.70 and updated the
test suite to match.  [Bug #1001417]

=item *

Updated preproc implementation (deHTMLxs) to match other clients.

=back

=head2 2.72 (June 16, 2005)

=over 4

=item *

C<razor-client> no longer creates symlinks to itself upon installation;
four new scripts have been added to the distribution to replace this
functionality (C<razor-admin>, C<razor-check>, C<razor-report>, C<razor-revoke>).

=back

=head2 2.71 (June 15, 2005)

=over 4

=item *

A fix to Makefile.PL script to correctly invoke C<razor-client>
after installation. Thanks to Liam Quinn for the patch.

=back

=head2 2.70 (June 10, 2005)

=over 4

=item *

Fixed preprocessing of unusual HTML messages. This resolves the
segfault issue in razor-agents. [Bug #1001417]

=item *

Fixed handling of certain malformed headers.

=item *

Explicitly specify the record separator as C<\n> when reading files, to
ensure that someone else hasn't set it to undef. [Patch #537813]

=item *

C<razorzone> is no longer supported and has been removed from the
documentation.

=item *

Allow the config file to set razorhome.  [Bug #1074391]

=item *

Razor Agents no longer go into an infinite loop when discovery
fails. [Bug #1016039]

=item *

Properly creates C<razor-*> symlinks after installation.  [Bug #874468]

=item *

Default to PERLPREFIX instead of PREFIX when installing man5 pages.
[Bug #1001320]

=item *

Removed a call to $sha1->reset() which was breaking SHA1 calculation.
[Bug #1004858]

=item *

C<use_engines> is no longer supported and has been removed from
the documentation.  [Bug #1120311]

=item *

Shuffle the discovery, catalogue, and nomination server lists
after loading them from disk; this prevents razor-agents from
always starting with the same catalogue server.

=item *

Replace the complex DNS lookup logic for discovery servers with
a single DNS round robin.  [Bug #604679]

=item *

Remove the ICMP ping logic for finding the "fastest" catalogue
server; the configuration option for this logic is now ignored.
[Support #739464]

=item *

Removed stale engine code for various signature types that are no
longer used.

=back

=head2 2.67 (December 03, 2004)

=over 4

=item *

This is a patch release that fixes a bug in the Whiplash
signature scheme. The bug was in the new code added to support
canonicalization of domains. It caused the signature algorithm
to generate no signatures on valid content.

=back

=head2 2.66 (December 02, 2004)

=over 4

=item *

Introduced support for country domain canonicalization in the
Whiplash signature scheme. This means domains like foo.co.uk
would be extracted correctly by Whiplash. This change affords a
considerable improvement in accuracy.

=item *

Modified the revocation logic to do signature-only
communications with the server. All versions of razor-agents
prior to this sent the entire message on razor-revoke, and even
though the backend would drop the messages after computing
signatures, this entailed a privacy risk. From this version on
razor-agents will _never_ send the contents of a revoked message
to the backend servers.

=item *

Fixed a bug in C<se> (supported engines) computation, which was
broken when the C<se> mask was larger than 8 bits. This would
sometimes disable the use of engine 4 (ehash). This fix would
also afford an increase in accuracy due to ehash being used
everytime.

=item *

Fixed a bug in report by message. Version 2.61 would drop MIME
headers on certain spam messages which would cause the backend
to ignore these messages as malformed.

=back

=head1 2.61 (July 06, 2004)

=over 4

=item *

Introduced the Whiplash signature scheme. Whiplash signatures
are based on canonical domain names present in URLs embedded in
spam messages. A Whiplash signature is also a function of the
length of the spam message. It's important to note that not all
whiplashes are used as classifiers. The Whiplash engine is
augmented by sophesticated logic on the Razor2 backend to select
the Whiplashes that are used to filter spam.

=item *

Fixed a bug in MIME parser whereby some broken MIME mails were
invisible to the system. [Bug #788723]

=item *

We override the C<use_engines> parameter in the config file
because this version supports different engines but leaves the
config file untouched. [Bug #984374]

=item *

Engine 1 support completely removed. Engine 1 was a signature
scheme compatible with the old razor v1 signatures, which is no
longer supported on the backend. [Bug #975490]

=back

=head1 2.40 (Dec 07, 2003)

=over 4

=item *

Applied patch from Michael (lemkemch) to make Razor Agents work on VMS.
(SF patch #797003).

=item *

Applied another Makefile.PL patch from Michael Schwern to correctly
install manpages in part 5 of the manual set in various versions of perl.

=item *

Applied patch from Mark Martinec and Vivek Khera of Amavid to untaint
various file targets obtained from user input. This is the same patch pointed
to by the SpamAssassin FAQ
[http://www.spamassassin.org/released/Razor2.patch]

=item *

Support for HTTP 1.1 tunneling [SF patch #821324] by Jon Schewe.

=item *

Applied Anne Bennett's patch to Logger.pm to introduce a new log
target, "syslog-sys", that talks to Syslog over a Unix socket rather
than a TCP socket.

=item *

Applied Anne Bennett's patch to deHTML.xs to get rid of the type
mismatch warning.

=item *

Removed computation of signatures that are no longer supported by the
backend -- engines 1, 2 and 3. Digest::Nilsimsa no longer required by
Razor Agents.

=back

=head1 2.36 (Aug 05, 2003)

=over 4

=item *

Removed some experimental code.

=back

=head1 2.35 (Aug 05, 2003)

=over 4

=item *

Applied a patch to Makefile.PL by Michael Schwern. This patch makes
Makefile.PL compatible with new MakeMaker and behave better in general.

=item *

C++ style comments in deHTML code replaced with C comments so the code
compiles with C compilers other than GCC.

=item *

Applied patch [SF patch #766292] by Suren A. Chilingaryan to detect and
skip body parts that only contain MIME headers.

=back

=head1 2.34 (May 16, 2003)

=over 4

=item *

Fixed a bug where razor-check would terminate prematurely on messages for
which it could not compute a signature. Thanks to Bela Lubkin for tracking
this and several other bugs down! [vipul]

=item *

We don't do server sorting by distance anymore. Most servers are closeby,
so we use the order the discovery server gives us. [vipul]

=item *

Introduced SOCKS support. Net::SOCKS is required in order to use SOCKS.
Specify socks_server in the config file. [vipul]

=item *

Fixed a bug in String::split_mime(); the MIME boundry was being spuriously
set in certain cases. [SF bug #707850 by Jams H Thompson]. [vipul]

=item *

Razor agents use getpwuid() instead of getlogin() to determine the user's
home directory. [SF bug #650410 by Jochen Erwied]. [vipul]

=item *

A bug in the selection of zone prefixes in bootstrap discovery was fixed.
[SF bug #604679 by Bill Sobel] [vipul]

=item *

Razorhome is gleaned from the config file passed to razor-agents, if all
else fails. "razor-report -conf=/etc/razor/razor.conf spam" will use
/etc/razor as its home if no other home is found (eg in $HOME/.razor).
To force a particular Razorhome value, use the -home=path option. [vipul]

=item *

Rewrote many error messages to be descriptive and helpful. [vipul]

=item *

auth=ai provides client name and version. [vipul]

=item *

discover() will force bootstrap discovery when all discovery servers are
unavailable. This fixes a bug where by razor-agents would try to connect
to the old Razor2 discovery server found in servers.discovery.lst. [vipul]

=item *

reportit() in background mode will return faster. [vipul]

=item *

checkit(), reportit(), parse_mbox(), etc take an ARRAY hash as an argument
when provided against the `aref' key. [vipul]

=back

=head1 2.22 (Nov 21 2002)

=over 4

=item *

Turned off verbose logging in ehash that was left on by mistake. [vipul]

=item *

Some user contributed additions to the FAQ.

=back



=head1 2.21 (Nov 19 2002)

=over 4

=item *

Ephemeral Hash reverts to the entire content when both sections are
composed of whitespace. This makes a certain type of false positives go
away. [vipul]

=item *

Razor2::Client::Core skips whitespace only message parts. [vipul]

=item *

DebugLevel 15 prints out the content after preprocessing, just before the
signatures are computed. [vipul]

=back



=head1 2.20 (Oct 15, 2002) (First Stable Version)

=over 4

=item *

If log file isn't writable for whatever reason, we write logs to
/dev/null. [vipul]

=item *

We look for stray C<\r>'s in the split_mime function. Thanks to
Jim <jim@ironchicken.org> for pointing this out. [vipul]

=item *

Added a significantly faster XS version of deHTML code. [vipul]

=item *

Made ::Agent taint friendly. [vipul]

=item *

Added support for passing an already open filehandle to C<::Agent::checkit()>
and C<::Agent::parse_mbox()> [vipul]

=item *

Made logic_method 4 the default. [vipul]

=item *

Added Razor2::Syslog to the package. [vipul]

Added deNewline.pm to the tarball.  It was missing from 2.06. [vipul]

=back

=head1 2.06 (June 15, 2002)

=over 4

=item *

Added a deNewline preprocessor that removes trailing C<\n>s. Reflected the
change in the server code as well. The reason for this is that MUAs (like
mutt) strip trailing C<\n>'s so there's no way to get to the original
message. This change necessitates upgrade from old 2.x agents. [vipul]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Config.pm to use EUID instead of UID to discover user's
Razor config directory. Thanks to Theo Van Dinter <felicity@kluge.net> for
